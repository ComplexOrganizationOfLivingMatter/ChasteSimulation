The event associated with the counter for 'Total' had already begun when BeginEvent was called.
Global node 0 had problems with ODE solve between t = 0.2 and 0.21ms.
Voltage at this node before solve was 280.836520219883mV
(this SHOULD NOT necessarily be the same as the one in the state variables,
which can be ignored and stay at the initial condition - the voltage is dictated by PDE instead of state variable.)
Stimulus current (NB converted to micro-Amps per cm^3) applied here is equal to:
	-6000000 at t = 0.2ms,
	0 at t = 0.21ms.
Cell model: luo_rudy_1991
