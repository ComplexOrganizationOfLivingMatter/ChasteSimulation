Global node 2 had problems with ODE solve between t = 0.68 and 0.6900000000000001ms.
Voltage at this node before solve was -88.98658928843777mV
(this SHOULD NOT necessarily be the same as the one in the state variables,
which can be ignored and stay at the initial condition - the voltage is dictated by PDE instead of state variable.)
Stimulus current (NB converted to micro-Amps per cm^3) applied here is equal to:
	0 at t = 0.68ms,
	0 at t = 0.6900000000000001ms.
Cell model: luo_rudy_1991
