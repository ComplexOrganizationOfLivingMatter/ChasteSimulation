Chaste warning: in file cell_based/src/population/VertexBasedCellPopulation.cpp at line 285: Vertices are moving more than half the CellRearrangementThreshold. This could cause elements to become inverted so the motion has been restricted. Use a smaller timestep to avoid these warnings.
Chaste warning: in file cell_based/src/population/VertexBasedCellPopulation.cpp at line 249: A Cell is removed without performing a T2 swap. This could leave a void in the mesh.
